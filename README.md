============================

These are the source code for the labs of the "Microcontroleur" course by Pr. Schmidt.

Every TP contains a Makefile, an m103def.inc file and some source code.

To create a new lab, just copy the template Makefile into a new directory, 
ex : "lab2/ex1" and change the target according to your needs. 

This source code is (c) 2012 Antoine Albertelli & Dorian Konrad unless specified else.
